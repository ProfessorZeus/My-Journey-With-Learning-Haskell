## ❔ Description

Welcome to this repository that stores my journey with learning Haskell pure (or is it trully?) functional programming language. It's safe to say that I am hooked and certainly fascinated! 
The text files containing my functions will gradually increase in difficulty, starting with simple Recursion, going into Higher-Order Functions, and endin with Haskell IO.

## 📥 Installation

To donwload and run my code, you will need to: 
  1.  Install Haskell GHCI. See the download instructions here 👉 https://www.haskell.org/downloads/ .
  2.  Run 'ghci "//copied path of the fil with your code" ' in the terminal window of your PC. To run my functions contained in .hs text files, download them from this repo -> copy as path -> put them in the quatation marks shown in the previous sentence.
